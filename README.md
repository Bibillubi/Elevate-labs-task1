Install Wireshark and start capture while running an Nmap scan on your network. Use filters like `tcp.flags.syn==1 &amp;&amp; tcp.flags.ack==0` to identify SYN probes. Analyze SYN, SYN-ACK, and RST packets to find open or closed ports. View stats, follow TCP streams for service details, export results, and secure vulnerable ports.
